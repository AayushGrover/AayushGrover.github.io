I am an integrated master student at [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). Integrated master program is a 5-year program that offers the undergrad as well as the postgrad degree at the end of the program. I will be graduating in 2021 with a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering and an M.Tech in Data Science. I started my undergrad in 2016 and have been a member of the [Dean's List](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/deans-list) ever since.

I am a research student with focus on solving the problems of molecular biology - drug discovery, proteomics, genomics etc using machine learning and deep learning techniques. I also like to keep a special eye on making sure that the technologies used in doing any kind of analysis are explainable. Neural networks and artificial intelligence holds a lot of promise. They have even delivered state-of-art performances in so many fields of research. I wish to bring such success to the field of molecular biology as well.

Since May 2020, I am a research intern at the [Computational Biology and Bioinformatics lab](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/) at the UCLouvain in Brussels, Belgium. I am building a deep neural model to predict the protein subcellular localisation which learns from various data sources. 

I am also a part of the COVID-19 drug discovery team, which is a collaboration of the [National Institute of Biological Sciences](https://www.ncbs.res.in/) and [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). The aim is to use the drug-reporposing technique to identify the most appropriate SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitory drug.

Before this, during the summer of 2019, I was a research intern at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany. I was a member of the [AI in Translational Psychiatry Group](https://www.ukm.de/index.php?id=translationale_psychiatrie). I was awarded the [DAAD-WISE](https://www.daad.in/en/find-funding/scholarship-database/?type=a&origin=4&subjectgroup=0&q=wise&status=0&page=0&onlydaad=&language=en&id=0&pg=1&detail_to_show=50015295) scholarship for the same. My work here was mainly focused on integrating a Bayesian-based hyper-parameter optimizer to the [PHOTON-AI](https://photon-ai.com/) python library. The aim of this library was to automate the creation of machine learning pipelines for researchers in different scientific fields. This helps other fields to take advantage of the power of machine learning without having to learn the underlying jargon.

Apart from building neural networks and automating processes, I spend most of my time either playing football or watching a football game or playing FIFA. I also enjoy bing-watching every now and then. I also enjoying travelling and am a foodie.
