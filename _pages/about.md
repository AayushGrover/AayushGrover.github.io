I am a doctoral student at the [Computational Cancer Genomics](http://boevalab.inf.ethz.ch/index.html) lab at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I joined ETH in Fall 2021. Prior to this, I was an integrated master student at [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). Integrated master is a 5-year program that confers both undergrad and postgrad degrees. I graduated in July 2021 with a B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering and an M.Tech in Data Science. My master thesis focused on building cancer survival models using multi-omics integration and few-shot learning. 

Over the last few years, I have built systems that aim to tackle problems in the field of molecular biology - drug discovery, proteomics, genomics etc using machine learning and deep learning techniques. I also like to keep a special eye on making sure that the technologies used in these systems are explainable. Neural networks and artificial intelligence hold a lot of promise. They have delivered state-of-art performances in so many fields of research. And I wish to bring similar success to the field of molecular biology. My doctoral research tries to take a step in this direction. I am currently focusing on deciphering the effects of non-coding mutations in cancer using artificial intelligence.

Since May 2020, I am a research intern at the [Computational Biology and Bioinformatics lab](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/) at the UCLouvain in Brussels, Belgium. I am building a deep neural model to predict the protein subcellular localisation which learns from various data sources. 
I am also a part of the COVID-19 drug discovery team, which is a collaboration of the [National Institute of Biological Sciences](https://www.ncbs.res.in/) and [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). The aim is to use the drug-reporposing technique to identify the most appropriate SARS-CoV-2 virus inhibitory drug.
Before this, during the summer of 2019, I was a research intern at the University of MÃ¼nster, Germany. I was a member of the [AI in Translational Psychiatry Group](https://www.ukm.de/index.php?id=translationale_psychiatrie). I was awarded the [DAAD-WISE](https://www.daad.in/en/find-funding/scholarship-database/?type=a&origin=4&subjectgroup=0&q=wise&status=0&page=0&onlydaad=&language=en&id=0&pg=1&detail_to_show=50015295) scholarship for the same. My work here was mainly focused on integrating a Bayesian-based hyper-parameter optimizer to the [PHOTON-AI](https://photon-ai.com/) python library. The aim of this library was to automate the creation of machine learning pipelines for researchers in different scientific fields. This helps other fields to take advantage of the power of machine learning without having to learn the underlying jargon.

Besides building neural networks and automating processes, football is my other passion - playing the beautiful game, watching a live game, and FIFA. I also enjoy binge-watching every now and then.
